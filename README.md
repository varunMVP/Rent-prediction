# 🏠 Rental Trend Predictor

The **Rental Trend Predictor** is a smart web application that predicts the **average rent for the upcoming month** based on historical rental data. It uses machine learning techniques to learn from past trends and gives insights into city-wise rental behavior over time.

> 🚀 Built with **Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- 📊 **Predicts next month's average rent** using Linear Regression.
- 📈 **Visualizes rent trends over time**, city-wise.
- 📋 **Evaluates prediction performance** using MSE and R² metrics.
- 🖼️ **Interactive UI** with tab-based navigation for prediction, visualization, and evaluation.

---

## 🌐 How It Works

### 1. **Data Processing**
- The app starts by loading rental data from a CSV file (`rent_prices.csv`) containing:
Month,City,AvgRent
2023-01,CityA,1200
2023-01,CityB,1300
...
- Dates are parsed and split into **year and month numbers** to help the model understand time-series behavior.

---

### 2. **Machine Learning Model**
- A **Linear Regression model** is trained on historical rent data.
- The model learns the pattern of rent changes over months and years.
- It **predicts the rent for the next month**, using the most recent date as the reference.

---

### 3. **Streamlit App UI**
The app is structured with three interactive tabs:

#### 📊 Prediction
- Displays the dataset and the **predicted rent for next month**.
- Offers a clear view of how past data drives future predictions.

#### 📈 Visualization
- Graphs rent changes over time, **differentiated by cities**.
- Uses **Seaborn line plots** to highlight month-on-month variation.

#### 📋 Evaluation
- Shows **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.
- Compares **actual vs predicted rent** using graphs.
- Helps understand how accurate the model is.
